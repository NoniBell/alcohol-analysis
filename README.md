# Alcohol Analysis

## So Why This Project?

We embarked on this project after Noni read a fascinating article (linked on Twitter, where else?) documenting the historical trends of drinking in the United States. This was a striking article to read for more than one reason: Regular drinking among legal adults can be both stigmatized and expected, and seeing the raw numbers of adult drinking patterns throughout history painted a more nuanced picture of this debate. Further, recent events, if you may have heard of them, have spurred a greater incidence of drinking within the population, and even greater alcohol abuse for the sake of either having something to do or feeling less anxious.

This website thus acts as a sort of curated exhibit of the data with some correlations of our own drawn in, such as Sarah's suggestion of looking at the Global Happiness Index in relation to drinking habits. We hope that in viewing this website people can begin to ask themselves further questions about individual, group, and societal attitudes toward drinking as we ourselves did.
